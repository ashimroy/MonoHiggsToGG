# MonoHiggsToGG
This repository is for the Mono-Higgs analysis. Here the final state is one Mono-Higgs (which decays to two photons) and Missing Transverse Momentum (MET). This MonoHiggsToGG framework is based on flashgg framework. Purpose of this framework is to produce skimmed ntuples from the microAOD data (which is produced through the flashgg framework).
